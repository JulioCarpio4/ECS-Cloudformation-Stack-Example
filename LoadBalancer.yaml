Description: A stack for deploying containerized applications onto a cluster of EC2
             hosts using Elastic Container Service. This stack contains all loadbalancing resources needed. 
Parameters: 
  VPC: 
    Type: String 
    Description: ID of VPC created in VPC stack 
  PublicSubnetOne:
    Type: String 
    Description: ID of the public subnet One 
  PublicSubnetTwo:
    Type: String 
    Description: ID of the public subnet Two
Resources:
  # Load balancers for getting traffic to containers.
  # This sample template creates two load balancers:
  #
  # - One public load balancer, hosted in public subnets that is accessible
  #   to the public, and is intended to route traffic to one or more public
  #   facing services.
  # - One private load balancer, hosted in private subnets, that only
  #   accepts traffic from other containers in the cluster, and is
  #   intended for private services that should not be accessed directly
  #   by the public.

  # A public facing load balancer, this is used for accepting traffic from the public
  # internet and directing it to public facing microservices
